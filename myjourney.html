                <p>It's my first year, so my first goal is to make new friends, adjust to university life, and participate in many activities. I've had the chance to be a staff member in various events, such as the upcoming Freshman Games. And it really bring be joy to achieving one of my goals.</p>

                <p>I hope to find out which area of this field I am particularly interested in, whether it's front-end, back-end, or if I don't enjoy this line of work at all. I also hope to deeply learn about what I’m truly passionate about, and I want to participate in various technology events to gain even more experience.</p>

                <p>I think this year will be quite challenging, whether it’s because of an internship or working on my final project. I also need to prepare myself for living independently. I just hope that everything I’ve learned at this faculty and university will help me get through life after graduation and Allow me to pursue the work I love and lead a fulfilling, happy life.</p>
