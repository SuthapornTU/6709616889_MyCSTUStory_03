            <p><strong>How do I see myself in 10 years?</strong></p>
            <p>By the time I’m 30, I plan to have graduated and started working for a bit before I’m ready to go back to school for a master’s degree in something I’m passionate about. Like I mentioned before, I’d love to work at a top global tech company, but realistically, I’d be happy with a job that involves programming. I also want to keep learning and growing, especially with how fast technology keeps changing.</p>
