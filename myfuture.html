            <p>The inspiration for me to study this field came from a movie about a protagonist working at Google, where they had to complete various activities, and the winner would get a job at the company. As a child, I was very impressed with the character in the story. What truly inspired me to pursue a career in technology was the relatively free and stress-free environment depicted in the film. I found it very cool when the protagonist had to complete tasks related to coding. Therefore, one of my dreams, although Iâ€™m not sure if I can achieve it, is to work at a leading technology company globally.</p>

            <p><strong>How do I see myself in 10 years?</strong></p>
            <p>By then, I will be 30, which is an age where I need to take life seriously. First and foremost, after graduation, I would like to find a job for a while until I feel ready to pursue a master's degree in a field of my choice. As I mentioned earlier, I want to work at a leading technology company globally, but realistically, I hope to at least work in a job related to programming. I also hope to continue developing myself alongside the ever-evolving technology.</p>
