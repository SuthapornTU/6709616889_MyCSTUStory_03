            <p><strong>How do I see myself in 10 years?</strong></p>
            <p>By then, I will be 30. First and foremost, after graduation, I would like to find a job for a while until I feel ready to pursue a master's degree in a field of my choice. As I mentioned earlier, I want to work at a leading technology company globally, but realistically, I hope to at least work in a job related to programming. I also hope to continue developing myself alongside the ever-evolving technology.</p>
